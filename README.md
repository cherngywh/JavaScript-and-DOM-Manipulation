*Write code that will create a table dynamically based upon a dataset(data.js). It allows the users to search through the table for specific pieces of information. There's a catch though... only use pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS on the web page. They are the only coding languages which can be trusted.*

**Step 1: Automatic Table and Date Search**

*- Using the ufo dataset provided in the form of a JavaScript object, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.*

**Step 2: Multiple Search Categories**

*- Using multiple input tags and/or select dropdowns, write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns.*

**Step 3: Paginated Table**

*- Import dataTables to paginate the table.*
